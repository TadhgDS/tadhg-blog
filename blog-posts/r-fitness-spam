{"title":"r fitness spam","mainText":"1. Be respectful and civil\r\n\r\n/r/Fitness is a place to discuss fitness in a civil manner. Personal attacks and unwanted sexual comments will not be tolerated. Prohibited behavior includes (but is not limited to) racist, misogynistic, sexist, and overtly offensive comments that have nothing to do with fitness.\r\n\r\nThese comments - whether intended to be a joke or not - are prohibited. Commenters can and will be banned for such behavior at the discretion of the mods without warning. Stay mindful of reddiquette and consider this reminder from the reddit admins.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, threads and comments that exist solely for the purpose of ridiculing other people are not allowed. This includes making fun of other people's exercise choices, performances, and physiques.\r\n\r\nAccusing people of using steroids or PEDs is also not acceptable nor welcomed here.\r\n\r\n2. All posts must promote discussion and be specific to fitness\r\n\r\n2.1 Minimum content\r\n/r/Fitness is limited to self-posts only. There are many reasons for this, but the most important is seeding quality discussion. As such, all posts require a minimum amount of content in the text box to clarify your question or provide context to a linked article.\r\n\r\nIf you have a simple PSA or sudden realisation that you want to share, or wonder if others feel the same way about something as you, there are other subs for that. /r/DAE, /r/TIL, /r/AskReddit, /r/Showerthoughts and many more exist for exactly those sorts of purposes. If you want to post in /r/Fitness, a modicum of thought and effort is required.\r\n\r\nAsking for help or posing a question\r\nWhen asking for help, people need relevant information to give you the best possible advice. Use the text box to describe your situation or problem as clearly as possible. Consider the suggested guidelines for a well-rounded post. Help us help you.\r\n\r\nWhen posing a question to fittit, don't just wonder aloud. Find the nugget worthy of investigation and provide your thoughts. It is not enough to ask, you also need to engage.\r\n\r\nSharing information\r\nIf you want to write or share on a topic in which you're knowledgeable, don't just dump some facts and run. Anyone can copy and paste a Wikipedia page. Attempt to relate the concepts to users and explain them in terms the majority will understand. Expect questions and to be expected to answer them.\r\n\r\nPosting off-site links\r\nWhen posting to share links to resources outside /r/Fitness, your post must contain the the following:\r\n\r\nSummarize the content. Give readers a reason to read the article or watch the video. Give a rundown of what to expect and what the takeaways should be. For some high quality examples of this, check out the following posts. 1, 2, 3, 4\r\nStart a discussion Talk about why you want to share your link, ask questions it raised for you, or offer your critique.\r\nIn other words, give us a quick rundown of why we should click your link and engage the community.\r\n\r\n2.2 Posts must be specific to fitness\r\nJust because something is tangentially related to the gym or happened during a run does not mean it is about fitness. While /r/Fitness may be the best, most-focused subset of people to ask, that does not mean your post is on topic or is allowed here. This subreddit is about health and fitness goals, and how we obtain them.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, do not post 'your story' or stories that happened to you, nuances of your gym experience, random things you see other people do, or simple self-congratulations. This sub is not a place to tease out your social dilemmas. If you feel you must share these with fittit, please use the weekly Rant Wednesday, Gym Story Saturday or Victory Sunday threads.\r\n\r\n/r/Fitness is not your diary or Facebook page.\r\nAny post that is deemed off-topic, adding no value, or otherwise inappropriate for the subreddit will be removed. The mods reserve the right to remove any post.\r\n\r\n3. Posting rights require minimum qualifications\r\n\r\nIn an effort to reduce spam, posting rights are restricted to users meeting a minimum account age and minimum combined karma. Any user or post not meeting these minimum requirements will have their post automatically removed but will be messaged with the appropriate options and outlets. If your post/question is adequately covered in the wiki, the mods reserve the right to leave your post unapproved. There are no minimum requirements for comments.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, URL shorteners are prohibited. As per reddditquette, the site-wide spam filter automatically removes any post or comment containing a shortened URL (e.g. bit.ly, goo.gl) and it is too cumbersome to check and approve each occurrence. Any comment or post getting flagged for a URL shortening service will remain removed, but the user will receive a message to correct the situation.\r\n\r\nNote: The specific minimum requirements are deliberately kept secret in order to make it more difficult for spammers to get around them, and will not be released if asked for.\r\n\r\n4. Progress/Achievement posts require relevant information\r\n\r\nIt's great that you achieved some goal or milestone, but without telling us how you did it, your post is nothing more than patting yourself on the back. If you just want to show off some before and after pics, take a look at /r/progresspics, as it is made specifically for that. If you still want to post to Fittit, there are some ways of sharing your success that help the community more than others. Further, you may also get more out of sharing your success if you tell us how you changed for the better.\r\n\r\nProgress and Achievement posts must include:\r\n\r\nEnding sex, weight, height, and age;\r\nDetailed diet and/or exercise routine(s) used, including specifics such as calories consumed, weight lifted, distance run, etc;\r\nBefore and after photos (for progress posts only).\r\nAdditional info to provide if available and as appropriate:\r\n\r\nPhotos or videos documenting the achievement, e.g. video of a PR lift or finish line photos;\r\nA race or meet report detailing the experience if this was an official event;\r\nAny other measurements made during this progress, waist size, body fat percentage, personal victories, etc;\r\nAdditional pictures, e.g. profile or side shots to show posture shifts;\r\nYour motivation or lessons learned;\r\nWhat are your next steps? What now?\r\nBy including much or all of this information in your post other Fittit users may benefit by learning answers to questions they may have had or did not know to ask. For tips and a posting template, check out this post.\r\n\r\n5. Asking for medical or injury advice is not allowed\r\n\r\nIf you're sick, hurt, or injured you should be getting help and/or advice somewhere else - preferably from a doctor. While people in Fittit might have similar conditions as you, not a single person will be able to examine you personally or understand your specific situation, and it's very hard to validate credentials over the internet. You should instead find a professional with proper schooling and experience who can examine and treat you in person. General Practitioners might not be the best for sports-related issues, so it is recommended that you find a Sports Medicine doctor or a Physical Therapist.\r\n\r\nProhibited topics include, but are not limited to: training advice with a known medical condition; training advice specifically involving an injured body part; and \"general experience\" posts asking about other people's experiences with a particular injury. Posts on these topics are considered requests for medical/injury advice and are not allowed. Posts seeking training advice that excludes an injured body part are allowed.\r\n\r\nIf you would like help identifying or correcting a painful movement, consider posting a form check.\r\nIf you post a form check and there's something wrong with your form; /r/Fitness can help with that. If your form is perfect, there's something wrong with your body and you need to see a doctor\r\nWondering if you hurt yourself or just experiencing normal soreness? See this FAQ entry. If you want generic \"injury\" advice, please read the FAQ entry on it.\r\n\r\n6. Moderators have the final word\r\n\r\nThis rule is for the internet warriors and conspiracy theorists. This isn't a democracy; your opinions will be heard and considered, but in the end the final decision rests with the moderators. We can't and won't make everyone happy.\r\n\r\n7. No bots or novelty accounts\r\n\r\nOffenders will be banned with extreme prejudice.\r\n\r\n8. No advertising or market research\r\n\r\nBlanket advertising of services, products, apps, websites, or fundraisers is not allowed here. Reddit has a built in system for advertising which you should use instead. /r/Fitness is also not a forum for you to conduct market research or to use as a polling place, study group, or brainstorming. Standalone posts fitting these descriptions will be removed. However, they may be submitted in our weekly Self-Promotion Saturday threads with impunity.\r\n\r\n8.1 Self-promotion\r\nWe do allow self-promotion posts within a narrow band of acceptable content. Users may post their own training and nutrition related blog posts, articles, or videos provided they meet the criteria given in the expanded self-promotion rules. These criteria cannot be used to supercede or circumvent any of the above listed rules.\r\n\r\nGeneral guidelines\r\n\r\n1. How to ask for help\r\n\r\nIf, after reading through all the wiki sections, you find that your question is not answered, you will need to ask for help on the Fittit subreddit. Contrary to popular belief, simply saying \"help me\" is not enough. We need lots of information about you in order to give you tailored advice. Everyone is different and not everything works for everyone.\r\n\r\nThings which should be included in your post for help:\r\n\r\nWeight, Height, Sex, and Age\r\nYour Goals (weight loss, muscle gain, etc)\r\nAny injuries or disorders that we should know about? (Diabetes, broken ankle, etc)\r\nDo you smoke? (If yes, stop. Stop now.)\r\nHistory of diet or exercise (What have you tried? What worked? What didn't?)\r\nLift numbers for OHP/Bench/Squat/Dead with rep maxes (if known)\r\nDo you have access to a gym?\r\n2. How to post a form check\r\n\r\nWhen posting a form check, you need to be aware of several things that can help us help you. You will need to record one or more videos of yourself doing the exercise, and then include them in a text post, keeping the following notes in mind:\r\n\r\nFor the video:\r\n\r\nRotate the video properly, if you recorded it sideways;\r\nMake sure your entire body can be seen, and equipment (such as a squat rack) does not obscure important body positions;\r\nInclude at least 3 reps or 20s of a static hold. If you cannot do this, you should provide a form check of an easier version of the exercise;\r\nRecord video(s) from 90 degree angles - sides, front, and/or back;\r\nMake sure the lighting is good.\r\nPlease include the following textual information:\r\n\r\nYour height and weight;\r\nName of the exercise being done (e.g. for a squat, specify high or low bar);\r\nCurrent maximum weight or progression for the exercise;\r\nThe weight or progression being used in the video;\r\nAny specific questions you may have;\r\nLink to the video (duh).\r\n3. How to get a routine critique\r\n\r\nPosts of this nature can be good; they help people learn to program properly, how to balance demands, and take things to the next level. However, the majority of comments should not be pumping the OP for more information. Without the pertinent information and diagnostics, giving a useful critique or advice is not possible.\r\n\r\nProgramming advice or routine critique requests should include the following information:\r\n\r\nYour current stats: Age, Height, Weight, and relevant PR(s) for whatever you are trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nA detailed goal. \"I want to get stronger\" is not a detailed goal. Specific goals require specific help - especially from people who have already achieved that goal - so that is what the focus should be on.\r\n\r\nA detailed version of \"I want to get stronger\" is \"I want to add 50lb to my squat\". Even more detail would include a date or event by which you want to achieve that goal. Other examples: \"I have a race in July and I want to drop 5 minutes off my 10K time\" or \"I want to make the 74kg class at an upcoming meet\".\r\nProposed weight programs should include rep and set schemes and ALL programs should include a progression plan.\r\n\r\nIf you are engaging is multiple training modalities (e.g. triathlon training; lifting + conditioning + sport specific practice) be sure to mention it as this will enable more holistic assessments and suggestions.\r\n\r\nIt stands to reason that if you want to create your own programming you should have a modicum of programming knowledge and the wherewithal to know how your body responds to certain training tactics. If you don't have this prerequisite knowledge, learn why nobody is critiquing your workout.\r\n\r\n4. How to tell someone to read the wiki\r\n\r\nCopy and paste the following into your comment:\r\n\r\nHi! Welcome to Fittit! You're going to love it here.\r\n\r\nWe saw you coming and have collected answers to your questions **[right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/index)**.\r\n\r\nWelcome!\r\n5.
