{"title":"CONSOLE CODE BLOCK","mainText":"The Nmap aka Network Mapper is an open source and a very versatile tool for Linux system/network administrators. Nmap is used for exploring networks, perform security scans, network audit and finding open ports on remote machine. It scans for Live hosts, Operating systems, packet filters and open ports running on remote hosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [root@server1 ~]# nmap 192.168.0.101\r\n\r\n    Starting Nmap 4.11 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ ) at 2013-11-18 11:04 EST\r\n    Interesting ports on server2.tecmint.com (192.168.0.101):\r\n    Not shown: 1674 closed ports\r\n    PORT     STATE SERVICE\r\n    22/tcp   open  ssh\r\n    80/tcp   open  http\r\n    111/tcp  open  rpcbind\r\n    958/tcp  open  unknown\r\n    3306/tcp open  mysql\r\n    8888/tcp open  sun-answerbook\r\n    MAC Address: 08:00:27:D9:8E:D7 (Cadmus Computer Systems)\r\n\r\n    Nmap finished: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.465 seconds\r\n    You have new mail in /var/spool/mail/root\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have more hosts to scan and all host details are written in a file , you can directly ask nmap to read that file and perform scans. Let’s see how to do that.\r\n\r\nCreate a text file called “nmaptest.txt” and define all the IP addresses or hostname of the server that you want to do a scan.","submitDate":1426650642756,"editDate":"","graphs":"","sn1":"sn1","sn2":"sn2","sn3":"sn3","sn4":"sn4","sn5":"sn5"}
